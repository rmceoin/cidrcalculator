CIDR Calculator is a simple IP subnet calculator for network engineers to quickly determine what the address range is of a subnet.

Given a subnet in CIDR notation the Android app will display the following::

* Maximum addresses
* Wildcard
* IP address in binary format
* Netmask in binary format

History is maintained of all addresses entered for easy call back.

A very basic IPv6 calculator provides::

* Address range
